**Test Restorant table monitoring
Your task is to develop the front-end side of a
Restorant’s tables monitoring system. The tables
monitoring should be able to display hundreds of tables
at the same time and should update the
table information when the respective event is received
from the server.
There is no need to implement server side so you can just
mock data anyway.
You should also mock random behaviour with table data
changes.
Each table could be represent as
{
id: string,
type: string,
name: string,
warning: boolean,
guests: number,
maxGuests: number
}
It’s up to you how to show table data.
Only few requirements - type should be represented as a
different image per type, and if
warning is true table should show blinking shadow.
You could run some function periodically changing
randomly table data for all or (also could be
randomly) some tables.
You can use the following types of tables:
- Dining Table - Standard tables for meals.
- Booth Table - Tables with fixed seating, often in a
booth.
- Outdoor Table - Tables placed on a patio or outdoor
seating area.
- Private Dining Table - Tables in a secluded or private
area.**
